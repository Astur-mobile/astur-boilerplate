/**
 * React Native **debug** build, attached to Metro.
 *
 * This config exists for one capability the release suite structurally cannot
 * cover: `device.network`. React Native's CDP network reporter sits behind a
 * compile-time flag that is off in release builds, so the shipped
 * `assets/astur.demo.android.apk` reports `observe: false` and the network spec
 * skips — correctly, but without ever exercising the backend.
 *
 * Everything else is identical to `playwright.config.ts`; the same shared specs
 * run here, against the same demo app, on the same emulator.
 *
 * Prerequisites, both in the demo-app repo:
 *
 *   1. Metro running:            npx expo start
 *   2. A debug build installed:  npx expo run:android
 *
 * The build must keep React Native's own debug defaults — `useDevSupport =
 * BuildConfig.DEBUG` in MainApplication.kt and `debuggableVariants = ["debug"]`
 * in app/build.gradle. Both are debug-only, so the release artifact every other
 * suite validates against is unaffected.
 *
 * Override the dev server with ASTUR_RN_DEV_SERVER when it is not on :8081.
