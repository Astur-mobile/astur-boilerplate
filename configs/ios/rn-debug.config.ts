/**
 * React Native **debug** build on the iOS simulator, attached to Metro.
 *
 * The iOS counterpart of `configs/android/rn-debug.config.ts`, and
 * for the same reason: React Native's CDP network reporter is compiled out of
 * release builds, so the shipped `assets/Astur.app` reports `observe: false`
 * and the network spec skips without exercising the backend.
 *
 * The reporter lives in `ReactCommon`, so this is the same transport and the
 * same Astur client as Android — only the build command differs.
 *
 * Prerequisites, both in the demo-app repo:
 *
 *   1. Metro running:        npx expo start
 *   2. A debug build:        npx expo run:ios
 *
 * Unlike Android, no app-side change is needed: the stock `AppDelegate` already
 * loads from Metro under `#if DEBUG`.
 *
 * Override the dev server with ASTUR_RN_DEV_SERVER when it is not on :8081, and
 * the simulator with ASTUR_IOS_DEVICE_ID / ASTUR_IOS_DEVICE_NAME.
