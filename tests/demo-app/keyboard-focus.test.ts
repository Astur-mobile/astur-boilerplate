/**
 * `device.keyboard.type()` — typing at the *focus*, not at an element.
 *
 * `fill()` remains the right tool whenever the field is addressable: it resolves
 * the element, clears it, and verifies the value landed. None of that is
 * possible here, so this API is deliberately the fallback, not the default.
 *
 * It exists for controls the accessibility tree never describes — a multi-box
 * OTP field being the usual one, where the visible boxes are plain views and the
 * real input is off-tree entirely, so `getByType('textField')` finds nothing and
 * `fill()` has no target to aim at.
 *
 * The demo app has no such control, so these specs use the ordinary form input
 * and drive it the hard way on purpose: tap to move focus, then type without
 * ever naming a target. That is the exact code path an OTP field needs, and it
 * is the same call on both platforms — XCUITest types into the focused
 * responder, Android delivers to the focused view.
